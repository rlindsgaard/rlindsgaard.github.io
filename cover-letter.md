Being an early 80's kid, Ronni has witnessed how computers and technology has
taken the world by storm as he, himself, grew. From his earliest memories, he was
infatuated by the command-line interface of his Amiga 500. He wrote his first
real program, a dungeon game, as a BAT-script in pre-school. Website development
caught his attention just before Y2K and the big bubble where he tought himself HTML,
CSS and ASP 3.0 and piced up Java to make self-signed applets.

In the mid 00's, after finishing high-school he co-owned and helped build
[MediaStyle](https://mediastyle.dk/) as a startup working primarily in PHP and JavaScript.
His thirst for more knowledge made him realise his dream of taking a degree at
[DIKU](https://di.ku.dk/), graduating his MSc. in Computer Science early 2014. During
his studies he worked with web-development, services-integration and
designing/developing iOS applications.

He has since then accumulated experience and honed his development and design
practices, currently working in a position as Systems Architect at
[CSIS Security Group A/S](https://csis.com) where he works with various technologies and languages.
He applies thorough research and experience to his work, and is always on the
hunt for in-depth knowledge of the tools and frameworks utilized. He does his
best to keep a pragmatic approach and knowing that done is better than perfect.


Bonus info:
- He prefers biking as means of transportation. And is a stairs first person.

- He has a mainly green DISC personality type.

- He enjoys running, rock-climbing, hiking and outdoors life in general.

- His main expertise is, really, learning and applying lessons from every
  situation and experience presented to him in life.

- He would like to do more technical writing, but two small kids and a loving wife
  takes up most of his spare time so most of it ends up in the drafts drawer.

- You make his day by:

  - Analyzing and speccing your design before presenting your implementation.

  - Accompanying your code with great documentation (that glue the
    business' needs to the code without going stale quickly) -- you make it
    especially if you add graphs.

  - Presenting a thought out function/integration test-suite for your code.

  - Cleaning up the camp-ground.

- You make him sad by:

  - Breaking or mis-applying design principles tought by the ones who
    precede us, SOLID, DRY/WET, YAGNI, etc.

  - Clearly not doing the footwork with the tools you work with.
