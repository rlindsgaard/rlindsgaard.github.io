This is my space where I practice technical writing. The purpose is a mixture of notes to self and opinionated posts on software engineering and practices. Sometimes inspired by experience, sometimes more just philosophy or inspired by reading.

I hope to one day write a book standing on the shoulders of giants. First I need something to say and a voice. This is supposed to be my way of compounding experience to get there.
