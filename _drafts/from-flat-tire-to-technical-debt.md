Yesterday I went running. I was planning on commuting on my bike
to/from work today (three's 16 clicks each way) - I contemplated
shortly if it that was too much too soon, being on the upwards surge
of COVID downtime in the workout department. I ended up deciding
by the stoic/zen creed - there is just now that matters.

This morning my bike had a flat- that happens far too often in
Copenhagen terrain. So I could have stood there with no noteworthy
exercise yesterday _or_ today. At least not without having to
change plans for it to happen.

How does this translate into my work day? _There is just now!_, there is
just _this_ PR, _this_ changeset.

This is my chance to give it my best, to produce the best piece of code I can.
To hone my skills mastering the programming craft. Use proper naming, proper
structure, write code everyone on the team can understand. Apply all the lessons
from [Uncle Bob](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code-a/9780136083238/)
and [the pragmatic programmers](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/)
really.
And to not add on technical debt even though that might be the convenient fix
to solve my problems right away.

If there are little pieces of technical debt, this is my chance to address it.
Just that badly named variable or argument, splitting up those nested loops
or adding that missing unit test. Make everything a little less worse off.

It is not trying to battle the demons of yore, making structural changes.
There is a time and place for that, but chances are it will snowball, and that
is not what I'm here for. I can learn from it, make my ideas, and devise a
battle plan for next time I come around.

To me, _that_ is leaving the campground in a better state. Then, I do good, and I
do my part.

Yes, fixing it all requires effort and whatever it is it is overdue for a full re-rewrite.
Everything really is, the moment we're finished with something and enjoy the fruits
of 20/20 hindsight. That is not what I'm here for, and now is not the time.
But I need to place the cutlery in the washing machine, instead of next to the
kitchen sink, every time, or my kitchen quickly becomes a mess. -- and remember,
that I cannot expect this behavior from anyone else, so I better take the cutlery
that is already lying there too.

What can _you_ do now? When making changes to the code?
Any good you do today, will fend off technical debt turning into legacy code, The
[accumulation of marginal gains](https://jamesclear.com/marginal-gains) goes
both ways. You may even earn some points from senior engineers and/or your manager
showing ownership. You'll certainly get some from me.

It may not be your problem today, after all, if your PR gets approved, you can quickly
move along to the next task. There may be plans for the project or code in the future,
but is that a good enough reason not to take a bite of the elephant today? Plans
change, [busses happen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) -- and so does flats.
