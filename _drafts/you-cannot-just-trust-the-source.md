title: You Cannot *Just* Trust The Source, Luke

This post relates to my thoughts on a discussion I have had more than once with fellow developers regarding whether documentation is an asset or a liability.

The title is inspired from a rather dated article https://blog.codinghorror.com/learn-to-read-the-source-luke/ - however
I find links to it occasionally and I still deem it relevant.
