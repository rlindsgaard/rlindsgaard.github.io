title: A Component Documentation Scheme
---

In this post I will walk through the steps and information level I value for documenting a shared codebase.

- Document your code
 - Implementation notes
- Component overview
 - Internal/External
 - References
- 10,000 feet overview
 - What does this mean for the business
- Architectural details
- Application Telemetry
