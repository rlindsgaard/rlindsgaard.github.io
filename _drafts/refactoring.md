# Refactoring - More that just a practice

In this post I will discuss why I believe refactoring is not just a practice
but is a discipline and har technical skill every developer ought to know
and be a part of every job interview.

I will not go into depths on _how_ to refactor, there is enough litterature
on that already.

## Definition

Let us first define what I percieve to be part of this discipline and what is not.

## Why refactor?

### Other disciplines

- Essays
- Publishing

## Refactoring as part of the development cycle

I percieve it common knowledge [reference needed] that when we have finished writing
a feature, we have come to an understanding of the problem domain that would have 
led us to a much better solution.

This, is the perfect place to implement refactoring as part of the process.
