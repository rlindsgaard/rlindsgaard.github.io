## Ronni Elken Lindsgaard, MSc. Computer Science

### Profile

I am a [craftsman](https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) who loves building things, virtual as well as physically.

Since my years in middle school my hobby has revolved around internet technologies.  A hobby that have since grown into a profession, pure serendipity. 

I enjoy the process and labor that goes into designing and building software systems — therefore the business processes and quality of the resulting product is of high importance to me.

I have over 15 years of professional experience developing and maintaining software systems working across full stack deployed to different environments. On top of that, I spent half a decade more teaching myself the art of computer programming in private.

My MSc in Computer Science has given me a broad mathematical and theoretical background that enables me to quickly grasp and understand new concepts and technologies.

My development experience has given me a strong foundation and hard-earned lessons in
- Agile practices 
- Producing quality software
- Understanding and outweighing business and customer needs against “correctness”
- Running and maintaining production code.
- As well as many other.

I work towards mastery and in my work employ
- Pragmatism and agility
- Test Driven Development and Continuous integration
- Frequent refactoring based on deeper knowledge of the problem domain
- Well established design principles (and when not to use them)
- Frequent feedback and alignment from technical peers and stakeholders
- Experience based foresight

In order to thrive I need
- A clear separation of concerns and well defined priorities, goals, and responsibilities
- A culture of learning and continuous improvment within the confines of the team as well as on an inter-team and organisational level.
- A culture of responsibility — A strong team that can work autonomously and feel strongly towards the quality of the product.
- A culture of respect and inclusion, in meetings as well as in the canteen

Reversely, a feeling of stagnation or status quo bias from peers or the organisation is detrimental to my motivation. 

To the table I bring
- An honest, intelligent, mature, well humoured,  and respectful colleague with a professional mindset.
- Enthusiasm for the quality of the product regarding DevEx and UX.
- A positive, honest and constructive mindset who knows that empathy is important when giving feedback.
- An eagerness to share knowledge and experience via mentoring, pair programming and/or presentations.

### Education

I hold a MSc in Computer Science, specializing in software design
and software architecture. Throughout my studies, I worked part time
giving me the hands-on experience that academia do not teach you.

Taking an education was a deliberate choice for me, as I had earlier
partnered in a startup https://mediastyle.dk working with web-development
technologies. Where I was self-taught by, tinkering with various
technologies such as IIS/ASP/MSDB, the LAMP stack, HTML/CSS/JS,
Java (applets) and Actionscript.

Throughout those years I became more interested in the code than
the visual result, urging me on to a college degree.

- My Thesis concerned traceability in the continuous delivery pipeline.


### Previous experience
As a consultant throughout my masters, I was allowed to

- Make acquaintance with departments of various sizes.

- Gain hands on experience with different ways of work, especially SCRUM.

- Work with mobile development and multi-device applications.

My bachelor project, and part-time work during my first years
of college included writing one of the first iterations of the
software back-end serving https://iex.dk/.

Working as a partner in http://mediastyle.dk I was responsible
for:

- Designing our own CMS system on a LAMP stack, later making the
  strategic choice shifting to Open Source systems including
  Drupal, Joomla, Magento, and Wordpress.

- 1st line customer support

- System Operations and maintenance

- Bulk integration across different CRM/Webshop/Inventory
  management systems -- later to be component- and product-ized
  as IEX. A system that is a succesful product product and standalone company today.

- Customer and sales relations
