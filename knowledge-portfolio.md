A list of literary works that stands out as having changed the way I think, about
the software engineering practice or life in general.

[Kernighan and Ritchie - The C programming language](https://books.google.dk/books?id=OpJ_0zpF7jIC)
: Because anyone working with code really ought to know how to read and write
  simple C programs.

[Robert C Martin - Clean Code](https://books.google.dk/books?id=_i6bDeoCQzsC)
: A book about the basics of programming layout and style.

Andy Hunt, Dave Thomas - The Pragmatic Programmer
: A book about the basics of everything else than programming related to software
  engineering. If you read the old one, the 20th anniversary edition is well worth
  a read too (I read both).

Kent Beck - Test Driven Development: By Example
: Everybody thinks they know what there is to TDD by reading the blogpost
  about it. There is more to the practice, it is well worth it to chunk this one
  down and it's not that long a read.

Vladimir Khorikov - Unit Testing: Principles, Practices, and Patterns
: I have learned a lot from reading his blog https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/
  even more so by reading this book. And that is _after_ investing a great
  deal of effort in writing good tests.

Joe Armstrong - Programming Erlang
: This book is not only about Erlang. It is also a book about the fundamentals
  about distributed computing. The solutions presented to the problems in this
  book fills me with awe. For my account, Joe Armstrong managed to turn
  programming and design into an art.

[Fred HÃ¨bert - Learn You Some Erlang For Great Good](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/)
: Again, this is about so much more that just Erlang. If you work with
  microservices, this is a must-read.

Bruce Schneier - Liars and Outliers: Enabling the Trust that Society Needs to Thrive
: A book on understanding social rules and norms in our society, who we trust without
  second thought and why that is. And of course when and what happens if that trust
  is broken.

[Adam Smith - Wealth of Nations](https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/3300)
: A very long and very old book. It defines the foundation of modern economics.
  It is also a peak into how complex commerce, taxation, and currency was back
  300 years ago. Book I and II are the ones I deem most relevant.

Eric Evans - Domain Driven Design
: The fundamental book on DDD. It was a bit hard to chew through, some chapters where
  moving slower than others (as modern practices have adopted some of the points
  made in the book) - but well worth my time. I adopted a few practices and learned
  to coin some terms I could only vaguely define before.

Hector Garcia - Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a long and happy life
:

Mark Manson - The Subtle art of not giving a f**k
Mark Manson - Everything is f**cked: A book about hope
