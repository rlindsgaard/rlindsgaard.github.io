## Ronni Elken Lindsgaard, MSc. Coputer Science

**Systems Architect at
[CSIS Security Group A/S](https://csis.com)** with +10 years of technical experience
focusing on

- Systems integration
- High-level development/maintenance
- Stakeholder and technology requirements elicitation
- Department documentation
- Team consulting/training.

He applies best practices, experience, and thorough research to his work, continuously
sharpening his skills and knowledge on design practices, and the tools, and
technologies he works with.
He has a **pragmatic** and **empathic** approach to his own and his colleagues' work
knowing that **done is better than perfect**.

Being an early 80's kid, Ronni has witnessed how computers and technology has
taken the world by storm as he, himself, grew. From his earliest memories, he was
infatuated by the **command-line interface** of his Amiga 500. He wrote his first
real program, a dungeon game, as a **BAT-script** in pre-school. Web-development
caught his attention just before Y2K and the big bubble where he taught himself **HTML,
CSS, SQL (MSDB), and ASP 3.0** and picked up **Java** and later **ActionScript**
to make self-signed applets and embedded content.

In the mid 00's, after finishing high-school he co-owned and helped build
[MediaStyle](https://mediastyle.dk/) as a startup working primarily in **PHP,
SQL (MySQL) and JavaScript** whilst also performing **system operations and LAMP stack**
maintenance.
His thirst for more knowledge made him realise his dream of taking a degree at
[DIKU](https://di.ku.dk/), graduating his **MSc. in Computer Science early 2014**.
He worked part-time during his studies with **web-development, services-integration
and designing/developing iOS applications**.

He has since then worked at CSIS Security Group A/S, gradually earning a senior
technical position from a student position.

Bonus info:
- Biking is the favorable method of commute.

- He has a mainly <span style="color:green">green</span> DISC personality type.

- He enjoys running, rock-climbing, hiking, and outdoors life in general.

- He has actually *read* the books (and does not form his opinion reading TL;DRs)

  - The New Testament

  - The life-changing magic of tidying up

  - Test Driven Development by example

- His main expertise is, really, learning and applying lessons from every
  situation and experience presented to him in life.

- You make his day by:

  - Analyzing and thinking your design through before presenting your
    partial implementation.

  - Accompanying your code with great documentation (that glue the
    business' needs to the code without going stale quickly) -- you make it
    especially if you add graphs.

  - Presenting a thought out function/integration test-suite for your code.

  - Cleaning up the camp-ground.

- You make him sad by:

  - Breaking or mis-applying design principles tought by the ones who
    precede us, SOLID, DRY/WET, YAGNI, etc.

  - Clearly not doing the footwork with the tools you work with.

  - Mocking when you should have been fake-ing or spying.

  - Wasting compute time with a naive quick solution when a good design
    would remedy it.
