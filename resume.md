## Ronni Elken Lindsgaard, MSc. Coputer Science

### Introduction

**Senior Software Engineer/Systems Architect at [CSIS Security Group A/S](https://csis.com)**
I have +15 years of experience designing, writing, and maintaining production
code ranging over web-, mobile-, and backend-applications.

I currently work with backend system integration responsible for integrating with customer systems supporting critical security monitoring.

I see myself as a craftsman, employing a pragmatic approach to software engineering. I see technologies, languages and platforms as tools. I hold no overzealous opinions towards any, although I hold preferences — The right one is the what gets the job done. I love adding new tools to my toolbox and to improve my expertise of the ones I know. I am not afraid of reading the source, the manual, or the RFC. And I constantly seek to improve my knowledge and skillset through books, courses and just getting my feet wet.

I practice clean code and simple declarative design. I see testing and documentation as an integral part of writing software.

### A passion for writing code

I have been writing software for more than 20 years, learning myself object oriented programming before starting high-school.
Joining as partner in a web-development company I learned that I was more of a Steve Wozniack than a Steve Jobs, and that there was a lot I needed to know.

Working part time through my studies, have allowed me to continually gain the hands on experience academia cannot give.


### Technical Background

Being an early 80's kid, Ronni has witnessed how computers and technology has
taken the world by storm as he, himself, grew. From his earliest memories, he was
infatuated by the **command-line interface** of his Amiga 500. He wrote his first
real program, a dungeon game, as a **BAT-script** in pre-school. Web-development
caught his attention just before Y2K and the big bubble where he taught himself **HTML,
CSS, SQL (MSDB), and ASP 3.0** and picked up **Java** and later **ActionScript**
to make self-signed applets and embedded content.

In the mid 00's, after finishing high-school he co-owned and helped build
[MediaStyle](https://mediastyle.dk/) as a startup working primarily in **PHP,
SQL (MySQL) and JavaScript** whilst also performing **system operations and LAMP stack**
maintenance.
His thirst for more knowledge made him realise his dream of taking a degree at
[DIKU](https://di.ku.dk/), graduating his **MSc. in Computer Science early 2014**.
He worked part-time during his studies with **web-development, services-integration
and designing/developing iOS applications**.

He has since then worked at CSIS Security Group A/S a senior
technical position gradually from a student position. Through this career working with

- Data extraction from 3rd party sources
- Systems integrations and data formatting
- Event driven design
- Application telemetry
- DevOps rotation and development

## Bonus info

- I prefer to bike for commuting. I also enjoy running, rock-climbing, and outdoors life in general.

- I have a mainly <span style=“color:green”>green</span> DISC personality profile and know what that requires of me.

- I tinker and build other things than software with my bare hands.
