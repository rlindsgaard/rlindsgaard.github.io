## Ronni Elken Lindsgaard, MSc. Coputer Science

### Profile

**Senior Backend Software Engineer/Systems Architect at [CSIS Security Group A/S](https://csis.com)**
with +15 years of experience designing, writing, and maintaining production
code.

I am currently responsible for the design and implementation of
integrating with customer systems supporting critical security
monitoring with high-availability/fault tolerant requirements
using a service-oriented, event-driven architecture deployed
across  multiple systems. I balance requirements coming from multiple
stakeholders from within and outside the organisation.

I also do

- Full scope project planning, analysis and estimates
  (from pre-sales inception to implementation) in a kanban environment.
- Cross-project/High-level design and service infrastructure maintenance
- Technical consulting and alignment with other teams
- Department wide recommendations and guidelines
- Organisation of recurring department retreats and hackathons

In the past 8 years I have risen gradually in seniority from a
student position to a senior position holding the **second highest
technical development position in the company**. I have also learned
that **I would rather lead by example** than by position.

Working at the same company for almost a decade has taught me
how to design and **write code that must be maintained**. As a result,
**I practice clean code, best practices, and simple design**.

Throughout my employment I have had hands on experience with
- Full stack development

- Technical analysis and project planning

- Working in a DevOps environment including working on the infrastructure
  supporting

  - Continuous Integration

  - Testing

  - Documentation

  - Deployment

  - Telemetry

  - Systems monitoring

  across different environments including virtualization, cloud and SaaS.

- Ingesting intelligence form 3rd party data sources

- On-boarding and managing personnel

- Maintaining/Refactoring/Replacing legacy systems

I work best in a free-reins environment where requirements and
prioritization is aligned regularly. I like to spar often with
technical peers and project management to get the best result
possible and I use small iterations as I think early feedback is key to any
good design.
Getting a chance to present my work, either via peer review or
demoing, done or half finished, is to me the best way to share
knowledge and learn from each-other.

I see myself as a craftsman, **employing experience and best practices**
for writing software. I am not afraid of reading the source, the manual,
or the RFC.
I hold my work to high standards to such a degree that I have
had to cognitively learn that **done is better than perfect**,
that not all technical debt necessarily need to be resolved, and not
to expect my peers to have the same attitude towards
their work as me. Keeping a pragmatic approach to software engineering
and experience have also taught me to not have an
overzealous attitude towards any specific language, platform or
technology. They are all tools to get the job done and **I welcome
the challenge of new ideas and paradigms** any of them bring
to the mix.

I am on a constant journey seeking to improve my skill-set, and
to broaden my perspective. I do this via books, courses, and,
plain old, **getting my feet wet** -- Learning something new every
day is a personal success criteria for me.

### Education

I hold a MSc in Computer Science, specializing in software design
and software architecture. Throughout my studies, I worked part time
giving me the hands-on experience that academia do not teach you.

Taking an education was a deliberate choice for me, as I had earlier
partnered in a startup https://mediastyle.dk working with web-development
technologies. Where I was self-taught by, tinkering with various
technologies such as IIS/ASP/MSDB, the LAMP stack, HTML/CSS/JS,
Java (applets) and Actionscript.

Throughout those years I became more interested in the code than
the visual result, urging me on to a college degree.

- My Thesis concerned traceability in the continuous delivery pipeline.


### Previous experience
As a consultant throughout my masters, I was allowed to

- Make acquaintance with departments of various sizes.

- Gain hands on experience with different ways of work, especially SCRUM.

- Work with mobile development and multi-device applications.

My bachelor project, and part-time work during my first years
of college included writing one of the first iterations of the
software back-end serving https://iex.dk/.

Working as a partner in http://mediastyle.dk I was responsible
for:

- Designing our own CMS system on a LAMP stack, later making the
  strategic choice shifting to Open Source systems including
  Drupal, Joomla, Magento, and Wordpress.

- 1st line customer support

- System Operations and maintenance

- Bulk integration across different CRM/Webshop/Inventory
  management systems -- later to be component- and product-ized
  as IEX.

- Customer and sales relations
