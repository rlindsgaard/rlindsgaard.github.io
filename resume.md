focusing on

He applies best practices, experience, and thorough research to his work, continuously
sharpening his skills and knowledge on design practices, and the tools, and
technologies he works with.
He has a **pragmatic** and **empathic** approach to his own and his colleagues' work
knowing that **done is better than perfect**.

Being an early 80's kid, Ronni has witnessed how computers and technology has
taken the world by storm as he, himself, grew. From his earliest memories, he was
infatuated by the **command-line interface** of his Amiga 500. He wrote his first
real program, a dungeon game, as a **BAT-script** in pre-school. Web-development
caught his attention just before Y2K and the big bubble where he taught himself **HTML,
CSS, SQL (MSDB), and ASP 3.0** and picked up **Java** and later **ActionScript**
to make self-signed applets and embedded content.

In the mid 00's, after finishing high-school he co-owned and helped build
[MediaStyle](https://mediastyle.dk/) as a startup working primarily in **PHP,
SQL (MySQL) and JavaScript** whilst also performing **system operations and LAMP stack**
maintenance.
His thirst for more knowledge made him realise his dream of taking a degree at
[DIKU](https://di.ku.dk/), graduating his **MSc. in Computer Science early 2014**.
He worked part-time during his studies with **web-development, services-integration
and designing/developing iOS applications**.

He has since then worked at CSIS Security Group A/S, gradually earning a senior
technical position from a student position. Through this career working with

- Data extraction from 3rd party sources
