## Ronni Elken Lindsgaard, MSc. Coputer Science

### Introduction

**Software Engineer/Systems Architect at [CSIS Security Group A/S](https://csis.com)**
I have +15 years of experience designing, writing, and maintaining production
code ranging over web-, mobile-, and backend-applications.

I specialize in:

- Application design/architecture
- Backend systems integration
- Documentation (technical writing, automation, visualization)
- Testing

In my work I specially apply and continually focus on improving

- Pragmatism, working with the tools at hand and knowing done is better than perfect.
- Clean Code and design, learning and applying industry and framework best practices.
- TTD and Testing as first class code.

I read the stdlib reference, the man page, read RFC, or lookup the source code - whenever each of them is appropriate. Then, I start consulting google and stackoverflow.

### Technical Background

Being an early 80's kid, Ronni has witnessed how computers and technology has
taken the world by storm as he, himself, grew. From his earliest memories, he was
infatuated by the **command-line interface** of his Amiga 500. He wrote his first
real program, a dungeon game, as a **BAT-script** in pre-school. Web-development
caught his attention just before Y2K and the big bubble where he taught himself **HTML,
CSS, SQL (MSDB), and ASP 3.0** and picked up **Java** and later **ActionScript**
to make self-signed applets and embedded content.

In the mid 00's, after finishing high-school he co-owned and helped build
[MediaStyle](https://mediastyle.dk/) as a startup working primarily in **PHP,
SQL (MySQL) and JavaScript** whilst also performing **system operations and LAMP stack**
maintenance.
His thirst for more knowledge made him realise his dream of taking a degree at
[DIKU](https://di.ku.dk/), graduating his **MSc. in Computer Science early 2014**.
He worked part-time during his studies with **web-development, services-integration
and designing/developing iOS applications**.

He has since then worked at CSIS Security Group A/S a senior
technical position gradually from a student position. Through this career working with

- Data extraction from 3rd party sources
- Systems integrations and data formatting
- Event driven design
- Application telemetry
- DevOps rotation and development

Bonus info:
- The bike is prefered method of commute. He also enjoys running, rock-climbing, hiking, and outdoors life in general.

- He has a mainly <span style="color:green">green</span> DISC personality type.


- He has actually *read* the books (and does not form his opinion reading TL;DRs)

  - The New Testament

  - The life-changing magic of tidying up

  - Test Driven Development by example

- His main expertise is, really, learning and applying lessons from every
  situation and experience presented to him in life.

- You make his day by:

  - Analyzing requirements and presenting the
    design _before_ implementation.
  - Thinking in documentation with the code.
  - Cleaning up the camp-ground.
